## Introduction

I started this project because a company that I speculatively applied to asked me to see how far I could get in a few hours in order to assess my skill level. 

The task was to consume a public JSON API feed and display the resulting data according to a set of wireframes, also taking the following into account:

* The website should function as a single-page app
* Layout must match the wireframes
* Look and feel is up to me, flat colours for borders and background are all that's expected
* It must support the same set of browsers as Google Apps
* It should use responsive techniques to ensure it works on a range of devices
* It must be built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with SCSS or Less encouraged
* The use of AngularJS or Backbone.js are strongly encouraged
* And third-party libraries are find to use.

## Problems and solutions

In [My first 'test']({% post_url 2016-02-04-first-test %}), I walk through the wireframes that were provided to me and discuss how I think my attempt went. I talk about how much of the project spec I was able to accomplish and how I plan to continue working on it, as well as the initial challenges I faced when working on the project.

In [Show me the data]({% post_url 2016-02-11-calling-json %}), I talk about beginning the refactoring process. I look at how I handled accessing the JSON feed across my app - the first time I'd done anything like this before. I walk through how I went about setting up the Angular factory in the first place, and then look at why my original effort didn't work and what I changed to fix it.

And in [Filtering JSON data]({% post_url 2016-02-22-potato-filters %}), I walk through how I created all the Angular filters in order to display some of the incoming JSON data - the author name and the published date - in the way required. 

## Conclusion

This project was a real challenge for me - but one that I very much enjoyed. I feel like I learned a great deal that will be of benefit to me and that I can directly apply the lessons I've learned on this to other projects.
