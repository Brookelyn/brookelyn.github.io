At the beginning of my Bloc course - or, at least, somewhat near the beginning - I started blogging about what I was learning and the projects I was working on.

Partly this was because I'd applied for and got the diversity scholarship available to women (among others) trying to get into coding, and they ask those who get the scholarship to blog about their experiences. And partly, it was because I wanted to keep track of what I was learning and try to embed that knowledge by explaining the step-by-step process to something [other than a duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), although in a pinch I find one of my cats does the trick.

So I started a free WordPress blog. Many of my project write-ups include links to posts on it, but I thought that I'd also provide a proper link to the full site in case anyone wants to read it - especially as I'll now be blogging here instead.
