title: Getting started with Cocktail
excerpt: In which our intrepid hero starts her Cocktail project
---
A few years ago, my husband and I went to Oktoberfest in Munich with my sister and brother-in-law. As both this particular sister (I have three in total) and I read at a fairly obscene pace - we can both *quite* easily finish a book in a day - we decided to swap Kindles for the duration of the holiday.

While most of what is on her Kindle could definitely be considered beach reading, there was one book that stood out as something a bit different: [Boozehound](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Boozehound-Trail-Obscure-Overrated-Spirits/dp/1580082882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1454413898&sr=8-1&keywords=boozehound), by Jason Wilson. As soon as we arrived home, I ordered a hardback version of the book - and the dive down the cocktail rabbithole commenced.

Since then, our liquor 'cabinet' has spilled from the shelf above the wine rack in our kitchen to two shelves of our Ikea entertainment unit and a load of bottles shoved into various spaces behind mirrors and under furniture, and we've started to accumulate cocktail recipe books from people who know we're into cocktails and have no other idea on what to get us for (insert gift-giving occasion here).

### 901 Very Good Cocktails
One of the best cocktail recipe books that we have is [901 Very Good Cocktails](http://www.901cocktails.com/), by Stew Ellington. 

Stew has done a fantastic job of compilying a more than comprehensive list of excellent cocktails, and has made it exceptionally easy to find a drink in his book by nearly any criteria you could possibly want - you can search by main spirit, bitters, other ingredient (such as orange juice), season, type of drink... the list goes on. There's even a list called 'Pretentious or otherwise annoying', so he's definitely got things covered!

I'm going to try to turn this into an app that I can use to 'search' the book. 

### Cocktail (the app)
Very imaginatively, I'm planning to call my app Cocktail. 

I'm planning to start with a selection of 30 recipes, just to get things going. I want to be able to search by:

* main spirit;
* combination of two spirits; or
* cocktail name.

I then want to display my results in one of several ways:

* in alphabetical order;
* from the drinks with the highest proportion of the searched-for spirit(s) to the least;
* only the recipes that don't call for any other alcohol than the searched-for spirit(s).

I'm planning to use Firebase as my back end, as I've used it before - and my husband is currently working on a rather absorbing personal project of his own, and doesn't have time to build me an API.

I think I'm probably going to be using the Bootstrap framework, and I'd also like to get more to grips with Sass, so will be controlling my CSS through that. 

This will be the first project of mine that I'm properly starting from scratch on, so it should be a fantastic learning experience!
