excerpt: In which a little help sees our hero get a better grip on Javascript scope

It's safe to say that it's been _rather_ a long while, hasn't it? The past two months have been a truly horrific combination of:

* moving into our new house;
* someone in the family dying;
* someone in the family getting married;
* those two above points happening in the same week;
* leaving publishing after nearly 10 years; and
* starting my new, utterly terrifying job in web development.

(Not to mention, of course, Britain deciding that it would be a great idea to stick two fingers up at all its friends and allies across the world in a triumph of hatred and xenophobia, but this is all I'm going to say about that for right now. It's safe to say that I. Am. Not. Happy.)

So! That's been a bit overwhelming - but the exciting bit is that I've finally started my new career as a front-end developer.

### This

One of the most difficult things that I've found to get my head around is the idea of scope in Javascript, and especially how it relates to `this`. It's just so *undefined* - or rather, its definition changes depending on the context, which means that I always feel I can never really understand what it's doing or why it's there.

At the end of my first week in my new role, I asked my (excpetionally lovely new) manager if he had any articles he'd recommend reading - along with any suggested tutorials or similar. He helpfully sent across a few links 'to get me started' and one of them, [Everything you wanted to know about JavaScript scope](https://toddmotto.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-javascript-scope/) by Todd Motto, has been really helpful in making the idea of scope and how `this` is used much clearer. I wouldn't say that I completely understand it, but for the first time I actually feel like I know what a closure is - and that is definitely a step!
