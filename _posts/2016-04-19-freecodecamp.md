excerpt: In which our hero encounter regex for the first time

It's rather difficult to blog about what I'm learning when, mostly, I've been doing front-end tests for various companies that I applied to. There are also only so many single-page apps consuming a JSON feed that I feel should be included on my site (hint: one - although this will eventually be upgraded to the one that I'm actually the most happy with instead of the only one where it isn't obvious what the company is).

While it's a brilliant way of embedding learning, doing the same type of project over and over again also doesn't introduce me to anything new - and while there is much to be said for revising, right now I feel it would be the equivalent to me repeating three words in French endlessly instead of learning how to conjugate a verb.

### It's free, there's code and it's a... camp?

My husband sent me a link to [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) a while ago, but as I was in the midst of my Bloc course at the time I bookmarked it for checking out later.

I'm very pleased that I did, as it's a great resource that's been thoughfully put together. I'm also, however, very glad that I've done all the bits that I've completed so far, as otherwise it would have taken me a very, very long time to progress.

I'm currently in the Basic Algorithm Scripting section of freeCodeCamp's learning map, and it's introducing me to regex - otherwise known as regular expressions.

I'd heard of regex previously, but didn't really understand what the term meant. It's just not focused on very much in the 'intro to coding'-type tutorials, so it's nice to be facing a new challenge that builds on the knowledge that I've won so far.

freeCodeCamp doesn't really give much in terms of links to outside resources, so I looked around and found a few regex tutorials - [RegexOne](http://regexone.com/) has been what I've mainly been using. 

It'll be interesting to see if and how I start using regex in my projects!
