Well. I have absolutely no idea whatsoever how that went.

Last week, I was surprised to receive an email asking me to do a little project for a company I'd sent my CV off to so they could see where my skills are at. This was the first time that I'd been asked to do something like this and I was, honestly, pretty excited.


### The spec

I was asked to create a single-page app that consumed a public JSON feed - a search for the tag 'potato' on Flickr - and displayed the results according to three basic wireframes, which I've included below. The look and feel of the design was up to me, but it needed to use responsive techniques and be built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where SCSS was encouraged. It was also suggested that either AngularJS or Backbone.js be used, and that I should only spend 'a few hours' on it. There were a lot of extras that they suggested they'd like to see 'if I had time' as well.

### It went... okay?

One of the hardest things about moving into a new career through a slightly untraditional path is that I've got no idea of whether I'm any good or not. I can track my progression through learning easily - after all, when I can do something again after it taking me ages the first time, it's pretty clear that I'm getting more comfortable with it.

But I don't know anyone else who is currently even vaguely near where I am in terms of front-end tech. I know a few people who have been in the field for years, so they're the worst possible comparisons as they have 10 years in the industry under their belt and can - for the moment, at least - effectively run in circles around me. Because I don't have anyone else to compare myself with, I have no idea where my skills are on the spectrum.

[Here's what I managed to put together.](http://brooke-balza-potato-project.herokuapp.com/)

I'm pretty disappointed with what I produced, but because of the above I'm not sure whether or not I should be. 

This was an unexpectedly complex project, and while I'm positive they did not expect me to complete all the functionality that they requested - mainly because my lovely husband said that usually, you're not expected to finish the task and the point is to see how far you get - I still feel as though I should have been able to do more, and that I should have been able to do it better and faster.

It also felt like everything that could go wrong totally went wrong. Bootstrap was being a complete ass and I couldn't get it to work, and because I've only used it a few times I have no idea why. There were a lot of (to me) fairly fiddly, complex JS bits that I hadn't done anything similar to before, which meant that they didn't get done.

It took me a few days to move away from complete and total despair with this one, as had I posted this last week after 'completing' the task, this post would have simply said TOTAL FAILURE I WILL NEVER GET A JOB over and over again in 72pt, possibly flashing, type.


### I will OWN you, tiny project

After talking it through with the hubs, as well as forcing the guys I know at my current job who deal with front-end stuff to look at it, I'm not feeling so despairing. Yeah, I'm *totally* not happy with the project as it currently sits... So I'm going to keep working on it.

I want to:

* refactor my current code and get the Bootstrap responsive grid layout I had planned working;
* figure out how to do *everything* to get my layout looking like the wireframes, which is going to take some considerable time and effort; and
* implement all the suggested extras, which include a search function, infinite scrolling or 'load more'-style pagination and a Google +1 button.

There are so many things about this project that I've never done before, or have only done once a while ago, and I absolutely would not have been able to self-direct to learn them as they simply wouldn't have occurred to me. 

So even if I don't hear back positively from the company, this project has already been an awesome learning experience - and it's really exciting to finally be finding out what businesses are looking for from a front-end dev instead of just guessing.
