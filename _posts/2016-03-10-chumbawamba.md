Looking for a new job, generally, is shite. 

First you've got to find roles that sound like they're going to offer what you want, at a company that is hopefully at least not a completely awful place to work.

Then there's the endless tweaking of your CV and the carefully crafted and individually written cover letters - oh, and don't forget that you want to come across like an awesome, fun individual instead of a robot.

If you're lucky, you'll get a template letter that tells you that someone - at least, you hope it's an actual person - has received your application and might do something with it. This person probably has absolutely no idea what anything on your CV actually means, so you're hoping that the words you picked for the game of Keyword Bingo you didn't want to play in the first place fit what they're looking for.

So when you add in that you're looking for your _first job in an entirely new industry_, things get even more shite.

### Optimism can only take you so far

Looking back on my job search so far, with the benefit of hindsight I realise that I was vastly too optimistic. I've been working in a rather niche industry for the past decade - and even within that industry, my role is niche. It's been years since I had to apply to more than one or two companies at a time, and when I did apply for something I _always_ heard back. I've even been contacted by companies asking if I would be interested in interviewing for a vacancy they have available without ever having applied to the business before. 

So it was a bit of a shock when only three of the around 20 companies that I applied to even bothered to let me know they'd received my application.

#### Great learning experience
The first company wasn't looking for a junior front-end dev - I'd applied purely speculatively, so was quite exited when they asked me to complete [a little project for them](/portfolio/2016-03-10-potato/). 

This was a great learning experience and really pushed the limits of what I knew how to do. While I wasn't what they were looking - they were advertising for a team lead and that is most certainly not yet me - they suggested that I think about reapplying in a year or so after I've got some experience under my belt. I'd love to work for this company at some point, as the projects that they work on are absolutely fascinating, and I really appreciated the time they took to give me feedback on what I'd done.

#### At least say thanks

My interview with the second company went fairly well until the technical test. I was asked to take a PSD and convert it into a functioning HTML document, complete with CSS and JQuery. While this mainly involved only changing the CSS, I'd never: 

* worked from a PSD, so had no idea how to access any of the assets in it;
* worked on a set-up that wasn't my own, on my personal computer; 
* worked to a time limit; or
* worked with CSS files that I hadn't, essentially, created myself.

I wasn't able to get nearly as far as I know I could, partly because of the above and partly because the CSS file I was provided with was so lacking in white space that I really struggled to identify how it all worked together - it was very similar to being presented with an A4 sheet crammed full with size 6 font and being told that I had to have it entirely memorised in 15 minutes. 

I seriously doubted that I'd be asked back for a second interview, as I knew I hadn't done well enough on the technical side to be hired. I'm a very firm believer that there is no excuse to be rude, however - and as I've still not even received a "Thanks so much for coming in, it was lovely to meet you, but you're not what we're looking for right now" kind of email, I won't ever be applying to that company again.

#### You can't be serious

The third company was, frankly, just weird. The first of the two interviews I had  didn't involve a technical test, but did see the managing director grilling me in a hostile way about my university course (I graduated over 10 years ago) and jobs I'd had when I was 16. While I knew that I wouldn't be accepting the role even it they offered it to me at this point, I wasn't going to turn down the chance to do what was essentially my second-ever technical test when I was asked to come in for a second round. 

During the second round, I got another grilling about totally irrelevant roles that I'd held while in uni and was told - in response to my question as to why there were only around two women working in a company with over 100 employees - that "women just couldn't cut it as developers". _Excuse me?_ No. 

I did horribly on my technical test as well, partly because I absolutely bottled it and got so overwhelmed by nerves that everything that I'd ever learned went out the window. And partly because despite nothing on my CV indicating that I had experience with PHP - and the job advert not mentioning PHP whatsoever - it turns out that they wanted an expert at it. 

This one was a real shame, as the guy who would have been my direct manager was lovely and I think we would have worked together really well - but definitely not with the managing director being such a misogynist. 

### Takeaways

While I've learned _so much_ since I started this journey, there really seems to be a gap when it comes to having to handle technical tests. 

I learned a great deal from my experience with these three companies - whether it was that I need to spend some time learning how to translate PSDs to HTML, or that I need to try to pinpoint why my nerves get in the way and how to prevent that from happening.

The most frustrating aspect of the whole experience of trying to get my first job in development is that I am so, SO ready to be doing this full time. I'm at the point where sitting at home with my cats in my pyjamas isn't allowing me to learn as fast as I could, and as I've finished all my paid-for training I don't have anyone to ask directly when I'm stuck and need some help to be able to progress.

Fingers crossed I'll be able to find something soon!
